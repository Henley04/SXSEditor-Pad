> **SXSEditor** — AI-Powered Singing Voice Synthesis Workstation

## What is SXSEditor?

SXSEditor is an open-source desktop application that synthesizes singing voice from MIDI notes and lyrics. It combines a visual piano-roll editor with the **SoulX-Singer** neural acoustic model, running through ONNX Runtime with GPU (DirectML), NPU (WebNN), and CPU acceleration.

You write notes on a piano roll, type lyrics, and SXSEditor generates a singing voice audio file.
