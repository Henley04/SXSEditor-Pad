/**
 * WSOLA (Waveform Similarity Overlap-Add) crossfade utilities.
 *
 * Replaces symmetric Hann OLA crossfades at vocoder chunk boundaries (time
 * domain) and diffusion chunk boundaries (mel domain). Plain Hann OLA assumes
 * the two segments are already time-aligned; on pitched signals a constant
 * phase/time offset between chunks produces flanging / comb filtering across
 * the overlap. WSOLA first searches for the best local alignment via
 * cross-correlation (time domain) or cosine similarity (mel domain), then
 * applies a Hann-weighted OLA on the aligned segments — eliminating the
 * comb-filter artifacts while keeping the overlap continuous.
 *
 * Both helpers return the crossfaded concatenation of length
 * `prevTail.length + currHead.length - overlapSamples` (the standard
 * "concatenate with overlap" length). When the two inputs are exactly
 * `overlap` long (the common vocoder-chunk case), the result is just the
 * `overlap`-sample crossfaded region.

/**
 * Time-domain WSOLA crossfade.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   1. Copy the non-overlapping prefix of prevTail and suffix of currHead
 *      unchanged.
 *   2. Over the overlap region, find ONE global alignment offset via a single
 *      zero-mean normalized cross-correlation search over the FULL overlap
 *      (search window ±searchWindowMs). This is intentionally NOT per-frame
 *      WSOLA: per-frame WSOLA divides the overlap into ~2 ms analysis frames
 *      and can pick *different* offsets per frame on periodic signals (the
 *      periodic cross-correlation has multiple equal peaks, so consecutive
 *      frames may land on different peaks and stitch together a discontinuous
 *      alignedCurr). A global search uses the entire overlap as the
 *      correlation window — the longer window sharpens the peak and produces
 *      ONE consistent offset, so alignedCurr is a contiguous slice of
 *      currHead with no internal discontinuities. This keeps the Hann
 *      crossfade smooth even on pitched (periodic) signals where per-frame
 *      WSOLA breaks down.
 *   3. Build alignedCurr by shifting currHead by the best offset (edge-clamp
 *      samples that fall outside currHead; the Hann window is ~0 at the edges
 *      so the clamp has negligible effect).
 *   4. Apply a Hann crossfade window over the full overlap:
 *      result[i] = prevTail[i] * (1 - w[i]) + alignedCurr[i] * w[i].
 *
 * @param {Float32Array|number[]} prevTail - tail of the previous segment
 * @param {Float32Array|number[]} currHead - head of the current segment
 * @param {number} overlapSamples - number of overlapping samples
 * @param {number} sampleRate - sample rate of the waveforms (Hz)
 * @param {number} [searchWindowMs=4] - global alignment search window (±ms)
